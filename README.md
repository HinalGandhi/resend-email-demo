## How to run

```jsx
const data = await resend.emails.send({
  from: "Thanks for contacting us<hinal.resend@resend.dev>",
  to: "hinal.resend@resend.dev>",
  subject: "Welcome to Black Panther ðŸš€",
  reply_to: email,
  // attachments: [
  //   {
  //     path: 'path/to/file/invoice.pdf',
  //     filename: 'invoice.pdf',
  //   },
  // ],
  react: EmailTemplate({ name, email, message, phone }),
});
